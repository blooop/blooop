### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a robotics research engineer with an interest in the design and operation of autonomous robotic systems.  I am interested in high dimensional data visualisation as a tool to guide research and development, which is why I wrote the library bencher to make the process more streamlined.  I have a unhealthy obsession with [automation](https://xkcd.com/1319/) but am getting better at abstaining where [appropriate](https://xkcd.com/1205/).

### My Projects

### Data visualisation
- [Bencher](https://github.com/dyson-ai/bencher) is a multidimensional plotting tool to make it easy to explore relationships between arbirary input and output variables

### Rocker extension and related tooling
- [template_rocker](https://github.com/blooop/template_rocker) is template for creating [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) extensions.
- [deps_rocker](https://github.com/blooop/deps_rocker) is a [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) extension that lets a user add apt, pip, etc dependencies in a composable way to existing docker images
- [pixi_rocker](https://github.com/blooop/pixi_rocker) is a [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) extension that add the [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi) dependency manager to existing docker images
- [lazygit_rocker](https://github.com/blooop/lazygit_rocker) is a [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) extension that adds [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) to existing docker images
- [rockerc](https://github.com/blooop/rockerc) is a wrapper of [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) that simplifies rocker commands by putting them in yaml files
- [rockervsc](https://github.com/blooop/rockervsc) is a minimal wrapper of [rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) that launches and attached vscode when running a rocker command
